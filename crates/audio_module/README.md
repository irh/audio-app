# `audio_module`

This crate includes a basic set of traits for defining stereo audio modules.

This isn't intended to act as a comprehensive audio module abstraction, but includes the minimal feature set needed by `audio-app`. 

Currently the only user is <`../freeverb_module`>, but eventually the overall project might grow to support other processors.
